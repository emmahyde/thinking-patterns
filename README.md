## Tool Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Tool

**Mental Models**: Best for initial problem understanding, breaking down complex systems, analyzing trade-offs, and finding root causes.

**Sequential Thinking**: Ideal for complex multi-step analysis, decision refinement, comprehensive planning, and problems requiring iterative thinking.

**Debugging Approaches**: Perfect for troubleshooting issues, performance optimization, system analysis, and error resolution.

**Stochastic Algorithms**: Essential for decision-making under uncertainty, optimization problems, resource allocation, and probabilistic modeling.

**Advanced Cognitive Tools**: Use for complex collaborative analysis, formal decision-making, scientific reasoning, and structured argumentation.

### Algorithm Selection Guide

**Markov Decision Processes**: Sequential decision-making with clear state transitions and defined rewards.

**Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Game playing, strategic planning, large decision spaces where simulation is possible.

**Multi-Armed Bandit**: A/B testing, resource allocation, online advertising, quick adaptation needs.

**Bayesian Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning, expensive function optimization, continuous parameter spaces.

**Hidden Markov Models**: Time series analysis, pattern recognition, state inference, sequential data modeling.
